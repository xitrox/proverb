# Proverb Frontend
There's a list in Notion maintained by three proverb lovers who are actively listening to people and collecting proverbs that are always wrong but sometimes only slightly. Often there are two proverbs mixed up in a funny way. Often those are hardly noticeable by bystanders but obvious if shown out of context. The collected proverbs have an author who originally quoted the wrong proverb.
The author is not always unified in the list (so no need to create a database or verify entries).
The Proverb Frontend serves three purposes:
- We would like to have the possibility to enter new found wrong proverbs easily and in a user engaging manner
- Show random proverbs and their author
- Search specific proverbs

## Features
This frontend serves the purpose to fetch wrong proverbs from a notion API and makes them browsable.
You can also use it to add more wrong proverbs to the list using the API.
The frontend is highly optimized for mobile use.

## Appearance
There's a random proverb at the top of the page. 
There's a reload button that loads the next proverb randomly.
Below that is a search field where you can match search for quotes. A list below that search field is filtered by the search term in a fuzzy search behavior.
The Color scheme is appealing to our target group of 40 something year old software engineers and product managers.
